# Introduction

Hello! today we are gonna be solving the Jangow machine from vulnhub, the description of the machine says that enumeration is key to solve the machine, so let's start hacking!

# Enumeration

First do a netdiscover -i eth0 to get the machine ip

Do a port scan to identify open ports with nmap, this will help us to know what services are running inside the machine

```shell

┌──(root㉿kali)-[/home/kali]
└─# nmap -Pn -n --min-rate 1000 -sS --open -T5 -p- 192.168.1.149 -vvv 
Starting Nmap 7.93 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-06-01 19:08 EDT
Initiating ARP Ping Scan at 19:08
Scanning 192.168.1.149 [1 port]
Initiating SYN Stealth Scan at 19:08
Scanning 192.168.1.149 [65535 ports]
Discovered open port 21/tcp on 192.168.1.149
Discovered open port 80/tcp on 192.168.1.149
PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON
21/tcp open  ftp     syn-ack ttl 64
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 64
MAC Address: 08:00:27:D1:85:A3 (Oracle VirtualBox virtual NIC)

Read data files from: /usr/bin/../share/nmap
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 57.46 seconds
           Raw packets sent: 131114 (5.769MB) | Rcvd: 49 (2.124KB)

```

This reveals port 21 and 80, with ftp and http running, ftp needs credentials that we don't have yet so go to the website and start to enumerate it.
There's a folder called site. That's weird so click the folder and it will take you to the 'real' website

# Explotation

I check the source code and it has a php file called "busque.php" with an rce

The machine seems to don't accept external requests after trying a ping to my machine so i can't get a reverse shell so lets check the files.
And in the wordpress folder there's a file called config.php that has credentials of a mysql internal server, we try these credentials with ftp
and we get an error but if we try the username found in /etc/passwd we have a success

```shell

┌──(root㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ ftp 192.168.1.158
Connected to 192.168.1.158.
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name (192.168.1.158:kali): jangow01
331 Please specify the password.
Password: 
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.   

```

After this i got stuck and had to check for a solution and since entering the vm screen and login there
seems something unfair the second option is using ReGeorg
if you run systemctl status ssh you can see there's a ssh service running even tho not accesible from outside

![](/assets/img/jangow/sshishere.png)

upload the reGeorg tunnel to /tmp and then chmod 777 it so www-data can copy the file to /site. then run Regeorg
and connect with putty to and the proxy to jangow ssh.

```shell
ftp> cd /tmp
250 Directory successfully changed.
ftp> put tunnel.php
local: tunnel.php remote: tunnel.php
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||23507|)
150 Ok to send data.

ftp> chmod 777 tunnel.php
200 SITE CHMOD command ok.

```

Running linpeas shows that the vm is vulnerable to A LOT of exploits so i pick the first one
upload it via ftp and compile it and run it giving us root access

The only thing left is going to /root and read the final flag fun fact: .bash_history shows how the machine was set up read it if you want.
I hope you liked the writeup have a nice day!
